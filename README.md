## Overview

**Investment Analyzer** is an AI-powered fintech SaaS platform designed to accelerate investment research and risk analytics. By leveraging advanced machine learning, Investment Analyzer delivers actionable insights, predictive signals, and real-time risk assessment using both traditional and alternative data sources.

This platform empowers investment professionals—including analysts, portfolio managers, and institutional investors—to uncover new opportunities, manage risk proactively, and operate more efficiently.

## Current Focus

Development is underway with these active priorities:

- **Data Integration Pipeline:** Seamlessly ingesting and normalizing diverse financial datasets (market feeds, alternative data, etc.).
- **Predictive Analytics Engine:** Utilizing machine learning (XGBoost, CNNs, sentiment analysis) for generating trading signals and investment insights.
- **Real-Time Data Transmission:** Building modules for secure, efficient data sharing between system components and APIs.
- **Risk Monitoring & Scenario Analysis:** Computational frameworks for stress testing portfolios and tracking exposure in real time.
- **Explainable AI Outputs:** Transparent, auditable output for each insight—supporting compliance and user confidence.
- **API & Web UI:** Initial SaaS endpoints and prototype analytics dashboards for direct client interaction.

## Key Features (In Progress)

- **Automated Data Flow:** Enabling secure internal and external data transmission, fundamental for live analytics and third-party integrations.
- **Signal Generation Preview:** Integrating sample predictive models for rapid analysis and hypothesis testing using historical data.
- **Configurable Risk Dashboards:** Building back-end logic for real-time exposure, drawdown, and scenario visualization.
- **Explainability Layer:** Early support for traceable model predictions and risk metrics.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
- **ML Libraries:** XGBoost, scikit-learn, (TensorFlow/PyTorch planned)
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend:** React (planned prototype)
- **Deployment:** Docker (containerization for rapid scale)
- **Integration:** RESTful API and WebSockets (for real-time updates)

## What’s Next

- Productionizing the data ingestion & normalization pipeline
- Expanding the model library (adding deep learning for advanced risk modeling and anomaly detection)
- UX/UI prototyping with user-friendly dashboards and interfaces
- Further developing the explainability engine for transparency and compliance
- Implementing authentication and permissions for users and organizations
